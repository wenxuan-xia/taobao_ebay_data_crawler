Prerequisit:
- knowledge of HTML, ask nijie for explaination
- knowledge of SQL, learn by yourself

some basic knowledge of HTML(imcomplete, I'm tired of typing)
1, HTML is a language for generating the visualization of a page. 
2, where to see HTML? go to a page on chrome, right click, select "inspect"(it usually the last option in the list)
In the "Elements", what you see is HTML
3, HTML is consist of tags: <div>, <span>, <label>, <h1>...
#################GO THROUGH THE EXAMPLE BELOW, after you finish it, ask nijie to show you some magic.############################
4, "<div>Bian zhaoying, how are you</div>". in this example, <div></div> is a common tag where we can add elements in.
5, elements can be understood as some words, some tages, or anything seen as a unit. in the above example, "Bian zhaoying, how are you" is a string element.
6, when we browse a website, why do we see different colors? how that works? 
<div style="color: pink">Bian zhaoying, how are you</div>
instead of the plain div, i add "style="color: pink", in the page, the text "Bian zhaoying, how are you" is in pink
this is one way to change the color, another way is to add a class
<div class="pink">Bian zhaoying, how are you</div>
this class can do nothing, but only when you define a pink class in another file, we call it .css file
in the .css file, we have
.pink {
    color: pink
}
7, if you understand the above, you will understand why we can use the tag, the classes to find an element, like the userlevel in the code.
